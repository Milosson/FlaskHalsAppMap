        The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that
        facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer
        programming. Previously, knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to
        publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. As of the
        2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this
        interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites. In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form
        of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also often build
        social relations with their readers and other bloggers. Blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online
        comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. There are also high-readership blogs which do not allow
        comments.
